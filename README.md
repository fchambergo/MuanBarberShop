<p>https://muansbarbershop.herokuapp.com/</p>

<p>This is a Front-End Development project for a local barber shop in my neighborhood. All accessible and necessary information for clients has been included.</p>
<br>
<p>This site was created using the following:</p>
<ul>
     <li>HTML</li>
     <li>CSS (Bootstrap 4)</li>
     <li>Javascript (JQuery)</li>
     <li>Express.js</li>
     <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>
    
Wireframes and design were made in Adobe XD:

Home Page:
Price, Map Location, Barber Schedule, Barber Shop Schedule information

Reviews: This page has the javascript implementation for creating a new comment. These comments do not stay after refreshing the page. Multiple comments can be created. The author name of each comment is the user's first name and the first letter of the user's last name. The date for the current day in format xx/xx/xxxx. The user's comment is then added to the top of the most recent comment.

<h4>Future Changes</h4>
<hr>
<p>
     <ul>
          <li><b>Mongoose</b> - Mongoose will be added to store multiple user's comments in a database. So after refreshing the page or revisiting the page, the comments will stay. </li>
          <li><b>More Animations</b> - The map location and address will slide in from the right to its specified location so there are opposing slide animations for two different rows on the same div</li>
          <li><b>Toggle Mobile Menu Align Right</b> - The home and reviews menu button will be aligned to the right in mobile view instead of being aligned to the left</li>
          <li><b>One active navbar link and one non active</b> - Starting off, the home navbar menu link will be active will on the home page while the reviews one will not be. Vice versa for the reviews menu link</li>
      <ul>
           </p>
